SQL Chat Assistant Project Description

Project Overview

The SQL Chat Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to bridge the gap between technical SQL queries and non-technical users by converting SQL queries into natural language descriptions. Leveraging the LLaMA language model, the assistant interprets SQL queries and generates human-readable explanations, making database interactions more accessible to users without SQL expertise.

Objectives





Query Translation: Convert SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, JOIN, WHERE) into clear, concise natural language explanations.



User-Friendly Interface: Provide a chat-based interface where users can input SQL queries and receive natural language responses.



Accuracy and Context Awareness: Ensure the assistant accurately interprets SQL syntax and context, handling various query complexities.



Scalability: Design the system to support multiple database schemas and handle diverse SQL dialects (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Key Features





SQL-to-Natural Language Conversion:





Input: SQL query (e.g., SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 30;)



Output: Natural language (e.g., "Retrieve the names and ages of users who are older than 30.")



Interactive Chat Interface:


Users can input queries via a web or command-line interface.



Real-time responses with explanations or error feedback for invalid queries.



Schema Awareness:


The assistant can process database schema information to provide context-aware translations (e.g., understanding table and column relationships).



Query Validation:





Basic validation to detect syntax errors or ambiguous queries before processing.



Support for Complex Queries:





Handle advanced SQL operations like JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, and aggregations (e.g., SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department; translates to "Count the number of employees in each department.").
